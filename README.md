# 2016 HiMCM

HiMCM is a high school mathematical modeling competition sponsored by COMAP
(Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications). The contest challenges high
school students to analyze a real world problem through a mathematical lens.

## Global Finalist Solution

This repository contains a solution for Problem A of that year and was awarded
the distinction of finalist (top \~7%). The project developed both an analytical
model as well as a computational model.

This work was a collaboration between students at the North Carolina School of
Science and Math. The members of the team were Adithya Balaji, Mukil Guruparan,
Skanda Sastry, and D Conner Borkowski. Below are some relevant links.
