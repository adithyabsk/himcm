# 2016 HiMCM

[HiMCM](https://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/index.html) is a high school
mathematical modeling competition sponsored by [COMAP](https://www.comap.com/)
(Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications). The contest challenges high
school students to analyze a real world problem through a mathematical lens.

## Global Finalist Solution

This repository contains a solution for Problem A of that year and was awarded
the distinction of finalist (top \~7%). The project developed both an analytical
model as well as a computational model. The below diagram represents the proposed
triathalon schedule from the above models.
